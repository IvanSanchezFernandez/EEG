<h2><b>DIAGNOSIS OF EPILEPSY</b></h2>
<br>
<p><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24730690/' target='_blank'>The diagnosis of seizures is a clinical diagnosis.
 The diagnosis of epilepsy is a clinical diagnosis.</a> Sometimes an EEG can help make a diagnosis of epilepsy <a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24730690/' target='_blank'>(see Table 2)</a> in the right clinical context, but that it is.
 Despite the fact that, in certain environments with a poor understanding of epilepsy, it is common practice to "rule out epilepsy" with an EEG,
 there is no such a thing as "ruling out epilepsy" with an EEG.</p>

<p><b>Q3. You find your colleague some time later. Your colleague is excited because a new prolonged EEG in the patient captured 5 of the clinical events under question,
 but no EEG pattern suggestive of seizures was found during these episodes. Now your colleague proudly says: "we finally ruled out that these are seizures" and
 "we finally ruled out epilepsy" in this patient. Your best response is:</b></p>

 diagnosed the patient with epilepsy and started him on antiseizure medications. Your colleague is extremely proud of it. Your best response is:</b></p>

<h2><b>INTERICTAL EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY</b></h2>
<br>
<p><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8082631/' target='_blank'>Interictal epileptiform activity occurs in (a small proportion of) persons who never had seizures and will
 never have seizures.</a> Ordering routine EEGs on patients with events which are not seizures will not clarify much. Interictal epileptiform activity in this
 context will probably represent <a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15652731/' target='_blank'>an incidental finding which should not be treated.</a> Remember:
 tests cannot replace a proper clinical history. <br><br>The first step in diagnosing seizures and epilepsy is taking a proper clinical history, the second
 step in diagnosing seizures and epilepsy is taking a proper clinical history, the third step in diagnosing seizures and epilepsy is taking a proper clinical history.
 Only after making sure that you took a proper clinical history and made a proper physical exam, ordering an EEG (or not ordering an EEG) should include answers
 to the questions: how the EEG will contribute to the diagnosis? is the proper EEG a routine EEG (likely to capture interictal abnormalities, but unlikely to
 capture ictal events) or a prolonged EEG (more likely to catpure ictal events)? if the EEG shows interictal discharges, how would that change (or not) the diagnosis and treatment?</p>

Sometimes he even walks around in his sleep. There are no rhythmic movements of the face or limbs.

<h2><b>SUMMARY</b></h2>
<p><b>EEG is a very helpful test. However, EEG is also a test with many limitations. EEGs do not "rule out seizures". EEGs do not "rule out
 epilepsy". Interictal discharges on EEG can happen in persons who never had a seizure and will never have a seizure. Therefore,
 it is surprising that EEGs are used in certain environments to "rule out seizures", to "rule out epilepsy", or to make a diagnosis of
 epilepsy when interictal epileptiform are found (regardless of clinical context). The popularity of the term "seizure disorder" is particularly
 worrying because it directly leads to patient harm (antiseizure medications in patients who do not need them or incorrect treatment duration in patients
 who do need them).<br><br>Your colleague in the questions above represented
 some of the most common misconceptions in the use of EEG. Unfortunately, these misconceptions harm patients because: 1) there are patients
 who have epilepsy, but their epilepsy is "ruled out" by a normal EEG and, therefore, these patients do not receive the antiseizure medications
 they need, sometimes for years and 2) there are patients who have not epilepsy, but the finding of interictal epileptiform activity makes them
 receive antiseizure medications they do not need, sometimes for years. <br><br> Make sure you understand these simple but powerful concepts
 and do not fall into the common mistakes your colleague fell into.</b><br>
