<h1>EEG4: Epileptiform activity</h1>
<p>Doctors who are not familiar with EEG think that EEG is used to "look for epileptiform activity". Obviously, that is an oversimplification
 because there is much more information in an EEG than just whether there is epileptiform activity or not. However, it is true that one of the major
 uses of EEG is to look for epileptiform activity.
<br>
<br>
Epileptiform activity (or lack thereof) is one of the major highlights of an EEG. The presence or absence of epileptiform activity
 frequently modifies medical management. When present, epileptiform activity may hint at the mechanism of onset of seizures. 
 As a crucial part of EEG which critically influences clinical management, you would expect that epileptiform activity has an objective
 and clear definition that allows all readers to agree on recognizing it and differentiate epileptiform activity from other EEG elements. 
 Are you ready for the definition? Well, ... there is no universal definition of epileptiform activity. Sorry! 
<br>
<br>
Yes, identifying epileptiform activity is an imperfect process mainly driven by pattern recognition based on prior experience, with no 
 clear-cut definition of what is and what is not epileptiform activity.
 Epileptiform activity is typically defined as an EEG element that is "pointy" or "sharp" and "breaks the underlying EEG rhythm".
 If there was a prize for the most unclear, subjective, and unsatisfactory definition ever, I would definitively vote for the definition of
 epileptiform activity. If one tries to go deeper into the definition and asks what does it mean "pointy" or "sharp"?
 or how "pointy" or "sharp" it has to be to be epileptiform activity? the best answer
 you will get is something like "it is sharp enough that if you sit on it, it will hurt". If you ask what does "break the rhythm" mean?
 the best answer you will get is something like "it is markedly different from the prior and subsequent EEG". To make things better, 
 not all EEG elements that are "sharp" and "break the rhythm" are epileptiform activity. I warned you that trying to learn to identify
 epileptiform activity based on definitions will lead you nowhere.
<br>
<br>
The good news is that using a few simple rules of thumb that you will learn in this post, you can easily identify epileptiform activity.
 Let's learn how to recognize epileptiform activity!</p>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


<p><b>Some features are typical or characteristic of epileptiform activity. These include:</b></p>


<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


<h2><b>EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY BREAKS THE RHYTHM</b></h2>
<br>
<p>As other defining features of epileptiform activity, "breaks the rhythm" is quite subjective. It means that epileptiform activity
 "stands out", "does not fit" with the rest of the rhythms in the EEG.</p>

<br>
<br>

	<figcaption><b>What stands out most in this figure for you?</b> Even people with no neurological or medical training would point to the
 angry-looking sharply-contoured elements in the inferior part of the image. They just "stand out". Epileptiform activity typically 
 (although not always) catches your eye.</figcaption></center>
</figure>

	<figcaption><b>Epileptiform activity stands out in this image, it catches the eye, it breaks the rhythm. Do you see it?</b></figcaption></center>

	<figcaption>Same EEG segment as in the figure above with a higher voltage scale, so that epileptiform activity stands out even more.
 Some epileptiform discharges are highlighted by the red arrows.</figcaption></center>
</figure>

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<p>Explaining "breaks the rhythm" is difficult in words, but may be more intuitive in pictures.</p>

<br>
<br>

	<figcaption><b>Wait. What?</b> Now this is something you were probably not waiting for, something that
 is markedly different than the rhythms that were typical for this EEG: <b>this is breaking the rhythm!</b></figcaption></center>
</figure>

<br>


<figure>
	<center><img id="breaking6" src="EEG4_img/breaking6.png" width=1200px heigth=1000px>
	<figcaption>After a brief moment in which the EEG looks clearly different, it goes back to the rhythms that
 were there before. Can you imagine what will appear in the next few fractions of second in this EEG?</figcaption></center>
</figure>

<br>
<br>


<figure>
	<center><img id="breaking7" src="EEG4_img/breaking7.png" width=1200px heigth=1000px>
	<figcaption>Yes, more posterior dominant rhythm, no surprises. You can mostly predict what is
 going to appear in the next few fractions of second of an EEG based on how the EEG looked until that point,
 but you typically cannot predict epileptiform activity because it breaks the rhythm.</figcaption></center>

	<figcaption>Here is the full EEG segment. Epileptiform activity is clearly different than the EEG activity
 that precedes it and the one that follows it.</figcaption></center>
</figure>

<br>
<br>



<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>




<h2><b>EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY IS SHARPLY CONTOURED</b></h2>
<br>
<p>
Epileptiform activity is sharply contoured. Yes, that is very unspecific, but it is one of the first features you should look for.
 If an EEG element is not sharply-contoured it is unlikely to be epileptiform activity.</p>

<br>

<figure>
	<center><img id="spikes1" src="EEG4_img/spikes1.png" width=1200px heigth=1000px>
	<figcaption><b>Epileptiform activity is sharply contoured.</b></figcaption></center>
</figure>

<br>
<br>

<figure>
	<center><img id="spikes2" src="EEG4_img/spikes2.png" width=1200px heigth=1000px>
	<figcaption><b>Epileptiform activity is sharply contoured.</b></figcaption></center>
</figure>

<br>
<br>


<p>There is a wide variability in the sharpness of epileptiform activity.</p>


<figure>
	<center><img id="spikes3" src="EEG4_img/spikes3.png" width=1200px heigth=1000px>
	<figcaption>Some epileptiform activity looks very sharply contoured.</figcaption></center>
</figure>

<br>
<br>


<figure>
	<center><img id="spikes4" src="EEG4_img/spikes4.png" width=1200px heigth=1000px>
	<figcaption>The sharpness of some epileptiform activity is less dramatic, but still sharply contoured.</figcaption></center>
</figure>

<br>
<br>

<p>Something that can make "sharply contoured" more specific for epileptiform activity (rather than other EEG elements which are also
 sharply contoured but are not epileptiform activity) is the pattern of steepness. You can think of the sharply-contoured part of epileptiform activity
 as consisting of 2 lines that join in the pointy part. In most cases, in epileptiform activity, the first part is steeper than the second part.</p>

<br>
<br>

<figure>
	<center><img id="steepness" src="EEG4_img/steepness.png" width=1200px heigth=1000px>
	<figcaption>In most cases, in epileptiform activity, line 1 is steeper than line 2.</figcaption></center>
</figure>

<br>
<br>

<figure>
	<center><img id="steepness2" src="EEG4_img/steepness2.png" width=1200px heigth=1000px>
	<figcaption>Do you see a difference in steepness? Maybe it is easier to see when you prolong the lines like shown with the
 red lines. Try to see the difference in steepness in the other epileptiform activity in the figure. If you still have difficulty
 seeing that difference in steepness, do not worry. It is a difficult feature to find and this feature is not necessary to identify epileptiform
 activity.</figcaption></center>
</figure>

<br>
<br>

<p>This difference in steepness is subtle and sometimes more difficult to find than just finding a sharply contoured element.
 However, it is also more specific too. First try to find sharply contoured elements in the EEG. Then, if you find the first line steeper
 than the second that makes it more likely that these elements are epileptiform activity. If you
 do not find this pattern of steepness, it still can be epileptiform activity. These are just rules of thumb, not definitive criteria and
 you should keep looking for other features before making a final decision on whether what you see is or is not
 epileptiform activity.</p>

<h2><b>EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY HAS A FIELD (WHICH MAKES ANATOMICAL SENSE)</b></h2>
<br>

<p>You can think of epileptiform activity as a stone falling on water creating ripples around it. The ripples are
 big around the point of entry of the stone in the water, but they get smaller as they get farther away.</p>

<br>

<figure>
	<center><img id="ripples" src="EEG4_img/ripples.png" width=1200px heigth=1000px>
	<figcaption><b>Ripples get smaller as they get farther from the stone.</b></figcaption></center>
</figure>

<p>By the way, this has not much to do with the underlying physiology, but it is an intuitive way to understand it.</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>Now that we are at it, you can think of little arrows pointing to the center of the ripples (where the stone entered the water).</p>

<br>

<figure>
	<center><img id="ripples2" src="EEG4_img/ripples2.png" width=1200px heigth=1000px>
	<figcaption><b>Imagine little arrows on the water signaling where the stone entered the water.</b></figcaption></center>
</figure>

<p>I think I already mentioned that this does not represent the underlying physiology.</p>

<br>
<br>



<p>How does this apply to the fields of epileptiform activity in the EEG?</p>

<br>
<br>

<figure>
	<center><img id="bipolar1" src="EEG4_img/bipolar1.png" width=1200px heigth=1000px>
	<figcaption>The epileptiform activity in this figure appears to be pointing to some electrodes. Can you figure out which ones?</figcaption></center>
</figure>

<br>
<br>

<figure>
	<center><img id="bipolar2" src="EEG4_img/bipolar2.png" width=1200px heigth=1000px>
	<figcaption>If you think of epileptiform activity as little arrows, here they point to the EEG channels C4-P4 and P4-O2
 (common electrode P4) and also to the EEG channels F8-T8 and T8-P8 (common electrode T8). So, let's assume that the
 epileptiform activity is pointing to the P4 and T8 electrodes. Does it make anatomical sense?</figcaption></center>
</figure>

<br>
<br>

<figure>
	<center><img id="head1" src="EEG4_img/head1.png" width=1200px heigth=1000px>
	<figcaption>You can think of the approximate location of the electrodes in the head. Then, try to
 picture the arrows and the ripples on the head.</figcaption></center>
</figure>


<br>
<br>

<figure>
	<center><img id="head2" src="EEG4_img/head2.png" width=1200px heigth=1000px>
	<figcaption>They would look something like this.</figcaption></center>
</figure>



<br>
<br>

<figure>
	<center><img id="head3" src="EEG4_img/head3.png" width=1200px heigth=1000px>
	<figcaption>Maybe the stone fell somewhere between P4 and T8?</figcaption></center>
</figure>


<br>
<br>

<p>If you pay attention to the montage we are using, we are comparing electrodes in an anterior-posterior
 direction: we are comparing C4 to P4, then P4 to O2; similarly, we are comparing F8 to T8, then T8 to P8.
 This is an anterior-posterior bipolar montage, likely the most commonly used montage in EEG reading. In the
 example above, it provided good localization of the stone in an anterior-posterior direction. However,
 as you could see in the prior figures, it did not give much information on the location of the stone in a
 medial-lateral direction. Let's try with another example.</p>

<br>
<br>

<figure>
	<center><img id="bipolar3" src="EEG4_img/bipolar2.png" width=1200px heigth=1000px>
	<figcaption>If you think of epileptiform activity as little arrows, here they point to the EEG channels C4-P4 and P4-O2
 (common electrode P4) and also to the EEG channels T8-P8 and P8-O2 (common electrode P8). So, let's assume that the
 epileptiform activity is pointing to the P4 and P8 electrodes. Does it make anatomical sense?</figcaption></center>

	<figcaption>You can think of the approximate location of the electrodes in the head. Then, try to

<br>


<figure>
	<center><img id="head5" src="EEG4_img/head5.png" width=1200px heigth=1000px>
	<figcaption>The stone would have fallen somewhere between P4 and P8. But, again, in the medial-lateral direction
 it is hard to point where the stone fell. We would need a different point of view, a different montage.</figcaption></center>
</figure>

	<figcaption>This is the same EEG portion in a transverse bipolar montage. Pay attention to how the electrodes are compared in this montage.
 Now try to locate the electrodes where the epileptiform activity is pointing to.</figcaption></center>

 (common electrode T8) and also to the EEG channels Pz-P4 and P4-P8 (common electrode P4). So, let's assume that the
 epileptiform activity is pointing to the T8 and P4 electrodes. Does it make anatomical sense?</figcaption></center>

<br>
<br>

	<center><img id="head6" src="EEG4_img/head6.png" width=1200px heigth=1000px>
	<figcaption>You can think of the approximate location of the electrodes in the head. Then, try to

	<figcaption>The stone would have fallen somewhere between P4 and T8. The transverse bipolar montage gives you
 good localization in the medial-lateral direction, but not in the anterior posterior direction.</figcaption></center>
</figure>



<br>
<br>


<figure>
	<center><img id="head8" src="EEG4_img/head8.png" width=1200px heigth=1000px>
	<figcaption>Combining the information from both montages, you can have a pretty good idea of where the stone fell.</figcaption></center>
</figure>


<br>
<br>


<p>If you think of the stone as a big negative charge in the scalp and the ripples as negative charges of smaller amplitudes as they get farther from the stone,
 that resembles as little bit more the underlying physiology.</p>


<br>
<br>


<figure>
	<center><img id="ripples3" src="EEG4_img/ripples3.png" width=1200px heigth=1000px>
	<figcaption>A big negative charge in the center of the field surrounded by smaller negative charges may (very roughly) represent
 the underlying physiology.</figcaption></center>
</figure>

<br>
<br>

<p>As an aside, the epileptiform activity as small arrows pointing to the stone (the biggest negative charge) only works for bipolar montages (montages
 which compare one electrode to the neighbor electrode). In case of a referential montage (a montage which compares each electrode with a "reference"),
 it is even easier: you can think of epileptiform activity just bigger near the stone (the biggest negative charge) and smaller as it gets farther.</p>

<br>
<br>


<figure>
	<center><img id="ripples4" src="EEG4_img/ripples4.png" width=1200px heigth=1000px>
	<figcaption>In a referential montage, epileptiform activity looks bigger the closer it is to the stone
 (big negative charge in the center of the field).</figcaption></center>
</figure>


<br>
<br>


<figure>
	<center><img id="referential" src="EEG4_img/referential.png" width=1200px heigth=1000px>
	<figcaption>This is the same EEG segment as in the prior EEG image above, now in a referential montage (comparing all electrodes to
 Cz, which acts here as reference). The biggest epileptiform activity is at T8, P8, and P4. Therefore, in a
 referential montage, the stone (the largest negative charge may be close to T8, P8, and P4), same conclusion than from
 the other montages. Different montages only give different points of view to better understand the same discharge.</figcaption></center>
</figure>

<br>
<br>

<p>Localization in EEG is easier than it may seem in this rough and fast introduction to localization. However, the focus of this post
 is on features that help identify epileptiform activity. Most epileptiform activity has a field that makes some anatomical sense, that
 is, the negative charge in the scalp has a maximum somewhere and gradually becomes less negative in adjacent electrodes. The
 field does not have to be perfectly symmetric, but it has to make some physiological sense. If the
 field has maximum negativity in one electrode and no other negativity in adjacent electrodes,
 in most cases, it is not going to be epileptiform activity.</p>

<h2><b>SUMMARY</b></h2>
<p><b>Remember these very simple rules of thumb:
<br>
Does it break the rhythm?
<br>
Is it sharply contoured?
<br>
Does it have a field that makes some anatomical sense?
<br>
The more you answer "yes" to these questions, the more likely that you are looking at epileptiform activity.
 Sounds simple and it is, but this will help enormously when you are trying to identify epileptiform discharges.<br>
