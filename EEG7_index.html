<h1>EEG7: Activation procedures</h1>
<p>There are several situations which increase the probability of seeing epileptiform discharges in the EEG. These activation
 procedures should be performed in each EEG (unless the patient has contraindications to them) to increase the diagnostic yield of the EEG. The
 three main activation procedures are sleep deprivation, hyperventilation, and photic stimulation.</p>


<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


<h2><b>SLEEP DEPRIVATION</b></h2>
<br>

<p>Sleep deprivation increases the chances of capturing epileptiform activity through two mechanisms: 1) increases the chance that the patient will fall
 asleep during the EEG (and sleep and the transitions in and out of sleep are periods where epileptiform activity tends to occur) and 2) a sleep-deprived
 patient is more prone to show epileptiform discharges in the EEG, even if that patient does not fall asleep.</p>

</figure>

<br>
<br>

<p>Sleep depriving the patient the night before the EEG and obtaining sleep during the EEG are arguably the most effective
 activation procedures to obtain epileptiform discharges. Fortunately, they are also the easiest: it only requires the patient to markedly reduce the
 amount of sleep the night prior to the EEG.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Q1. A patient is scheduled to have an EEG tomorrow and you recommend that he sleeps half his usual sleep time on the night prior to the EEG.
 The patient is worried about not sleeping because he has to drive for approximately 1 hour to get to the hospital. What is your best suggestion?</b></p>

<br>
<br>
<br>


<h2><b>HYPERVENTILATION</b></h2>
<br>

<p>Hyperventilation consists of making the patient breathe deeply and rapidly for approximately 3 minutes. In children, blowing into a
 pinwheel may facilitate this task. Hyperventilation causes a decrease in arterial CO2 with secondary cerebral vasoconstriction. This causes
 diffuse and symmetrical high-voltage slowing. It also increases the chance of epileptiform activity appearing on the EEG.</p>

<h2><b>PHOTIC STIMULATION</b></h2>
<br>

<p>Photic stimulation consists of showing repetitive flashing lights to the patient at specific frequencies. This can be annoying to patients and they might close their eyes. The
 good news is that, as long as the patient has his or her head more or less in the direction of the light, photic stimulation works anyway. The light causes
 its effect even through closed eyelids.<br><br>Each pulse of photic stimulation typically lasts 6-12 seconds in which lights flash at a constant frequency. That frequency
 varies from pulse to pulse with frequencies that go from approximately 3 Hz to approximately 25 Hz. A typical photic stimulation paradigm would give a pulse at 3 Hz for
 10 seconds followed (after several seconds without photic stimulation) by another 10 seconds pulse at 5 Hz, followed (after several seconds without photic stimulation)
 by another 10 seconds pulse at 8 Hz, followed (after several seconds without photic stimulation) by another 10 seconds pulse at 12 Hz, followed
 (after several seconds without photic stimulation) by another 10 seconds pulse at 16 Hz, followed (after several seconds without photic stimulation)
 by another 10 seconds pulse at 18 Hz, followed (after several seconds without photic stimulation) by another 10 seconds pulse at 21 Hz, followed
 (after several seconds without photic stimulation) by another 10 seconds pulse at 25 Hz.</p>

<h2><b>OTHER ACTIVATION PROCEDURES</b></h2>
<br>

<p>There are other activation procedures which are very specific to specific patients. For example,
 some individuals have epileptiform discharges or even seizures triggered by <a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25726285/' target='_blank'>music (or repetitive rhythms)</a>. Other patients
 have epileptiform discharges or even seizures triggered by <a href='https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-pdf/118/1/75/978756/118-1-75.pdf' target='_blank'>reading (or other language tasks)</a>.
 There are multiple other potential triggers for epileptiform discharges and seizures including <a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33417183/' target='_blank'>hot water</a>,
 <a href='https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-pdf/106/3/537/758592/106-3-537.pdf' target='_blank'>pain</a>, or many other potential triggers.<br><br>Those triggers are so patient-specific that they are not worth trying them unless there is
 some suggestion from the history that they might work in that patient.</p>


<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>



<h2><b>SUMMARY</b></h2>
<p><b>You should perform sleep deprivation (before the EEG) and try to obtain sleep (during the EEG). You should also perform
 hyperventilation and photic stimulation in each EEG (unless the patient has specific contraindications for it).<br><br>
Remember to ask your patients what specific factors trigger their seizures.</b></p>
